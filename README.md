# IdkJustAnotherRice
Just a config repo for my Dotfiles.
Mostly an ongoing project, with a lot of inconsistencies here and there.
Files in the case of just a starting point.

TODO: 
  1. Fix up non-working scripts and where the issues really lie at.
  2. Beautify the current waybar/SwayNC configs, and add more script functionality to the whole thing.
  3. Cleanup for a more structural formatting.
  4. Try other alternatives for waybar, like AGS or EWW.
