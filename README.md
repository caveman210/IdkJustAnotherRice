# IdkJustAnotherRice
Just a config repo for my Dotfiles.
Mostly an ongoing project, with a lot of inconsistencies here and there.
Files in the case of just a starting point.

Arch-Linux based, for Hyprland. 
Uses Waybar for status bar, Sherlock for the application launcher. 
Bluetuith and nmtui for the wifi and bluetooth TUIs. 
SwayNC for the notification daemon. 
Kickstart.nvim for the Neovim config. 

## TODO: 
  - [x] Fix up non-working scripts and where the issues really lie at.
  - [ ] Beautify the current waybar/SwayNC configs, and add more script functionality to the whole thing.
  - [ ] Cleanup for a more structural formatting.
  - [ ] Try other alternatives for waybar, like AGS or EWW.
  - [x] Kickstart.nvim for the nvim config: self made. (Separate repo.)
